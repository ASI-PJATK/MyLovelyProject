# Terrance
Make load function template arguments boolean

The documentation describes the `ac_template` parameter as boolean, but
the underlying `load()` function tests for `ac_template is not None`,
meaning `False` is ignored and files are always parsed as templates.

This updates the check to a truthy one, along with making the type
annotations and default arguments match the documented API.

Make logging behave

This PR removes all custom logging magic, and changes the behaviour to
the standard way of logging for Python libraries.

In short, instead of magic global loggers and setting global
configuration (so that applications experience problems), all logging
calls are simply emitted on module-level loggers. It's up to the
application to route these messages somewhere useful by configuring
handlers and setting levels.

Fixes #11.
